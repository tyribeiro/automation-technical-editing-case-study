# Style Guide and Global English Principles

This document outlines the editorial standards applied to the workflow documentation. These principles align with best practices for technical editing and certification content.

## 1. Terminology Consistency

Terms must be used consistently throughout the document.  
Examples:  
- Always refer to a "ClickUp task," not alternately "ticket" or "card."  
- Always refer to a "row" in a Google Sheet or Smartsheet, not a "line" or "entry."

## 2. Global English Standards

To ensure clarity for international audiences:

- Use short, direct sentences  
- Avoid idiomatic expressions  
- Avoid culturally specific references  
- Use clear subject-verb-object structure  
- Prefer concrete terminology over informal phrasing

---

## 3. Clarity and Ambiguity Reduction

- Avoid unclear pronouns such as "it" or "this" when the referent is not obvious  
- Ensure every instruction identifies the specific tool or module involved  
- Include preconditions before procedural steps

---

## 4. Editorial Tone

The tone should be:

- Neutral  
- Objective  
- Instructional  
- Free from speculation or subjective comments  

Example correction:

- Original: "mapping is confusing"  
- Edited: "Field mappings are inconsistent; renaming fields improves clarity."

## 5. Formatting Rules

- Use ordered lists for sequential steps  
- Use unordered lists for options or itemized information  
- Use bold for interface labels  
- Use inline code formatting for variable names, such as `list_id`
