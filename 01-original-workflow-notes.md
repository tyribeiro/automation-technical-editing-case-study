# Original Workflow Notes (Unedited)

The following notes represent the unstructured SME input before technical editing.  
They contain unclear references, missing context, inconsistent terminology, and incomplete sequences.

## Raw Notes

- clickup triggers the make scenario  
- need webhook in clickup for form submission  
- google sheet has list of ids, need to check if id exists before continuing  
- router but not sure if it should be before iterator  
- smartsheet module sometimes fails, maybe because of column type  
- need variables for list_id and smartsheet_id  
- scenario should stop if id already exists  
- mapping is confusing, clickup fields not named right  
- errors happen when sheet row missing  
- maybe use get a row instead of search  

Additional fragments:

- store the smartsheet id in variable  
- then use get sheet module  
- update row if row exists  
- or add new one  
- cleanup logic at end
