Automation Workflow – Technical Editing Case Study

This repository showcases my work as a technical editor transforming fragmented automation workflow notes into a clear, structured, globally readable SOP.
The workflows represented here involve Make.com → ClickUp → Smartsheet automation pipelines similar to systems used in real business operations.

This case study demonstrates my ability to:

Perform copyediting, substantive editing, and developmental editing

Turn raw SME notes into polished, repeatable documentation

Apply global English standards for a diverse audience

Improve clarity and eliminate ambiguity for technical and non-technical readers

Structure complex workflows into actionable, testable steps

Think like a Certification Technical Editor by integrating fairness, clarity, and assessment-style thinking
