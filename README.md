Automation Workflow – Technical Editing Case Study

This repository showcases my work as a technical editor and technical content designer, focused on transforming fragmented automation workflow notes into clear, structured, globally understandable documentation.
The workflows in this project involve Make.com → ClickUp → Google Sheets → Smartsheet, mirroring real-world business automation systems.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how I:

Apply copyediting, substantive editing, and developmental editing to technical process documentation

Convert raw SME notes into accurate, repeatable SOPs

Use global English standards to ensure clarity for international audiences

Identify and eliminate ambiguity for both technical and non-technical stakeholders

Think like an AWS Certification Technical Editor, prioritizing clarity, fairness, and precise sequencing

Enhance documentation with before/after comparisons, style guidance, and assessment-style questions

Context

Automation workflows are frequently documented in inconsistent or unclear ways.
This project presents both the raw “before” state and the editorially improved “after” state, demonstrating:

How I structure instructions logically

How I add missing context and preconditions

How I improve readability and technical accuracy

How I create content that is suitable for training, onboarding, or certification-style evaluation

This project mirrors the work a Technical Editor does with AWS exam content, exam guides, and technical reference documentation.
