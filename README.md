# Automation Workflow – Technical Editing Case Study

This repository showcases my work as a **technical editor and technical content designer**, focused on transforming fragmented automation workflow notes into clear, structured, globally understandable documentation. The workflows represented in this project involve **Make.com → ClickUp → Google Sheets → Smartsheet**, mirroring real-world business automation systems.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how I:

- Transform raw automation notes into **clear, concise SOPs**
- Apply **copyediting, substantive editing, and developmental editing** to technical workflows
- Maintain **technical accuracy** while improving readability for diverse global audiences
- Eliminate ambiguity and ensure documentation is **unbiased, inclusive, and translatable**
- Apply editorial logic similar to AWS Certification content: clarity, fairness, consistency
- Demonstrate assessment thinking through knowledge-check questions

## Context

Automation workflows are often captured in inconsistent, unclear formats by subject-matter experts. This project reveals both the **“before”** and **“after”** stages of editorial transformation, showcasing how I:

- Reconstruct missing context  
- Reorder steps into a logical, task-based flow  
- Apply global English principles  
- Use consistent terminology across tools  
- Ensure instructions are unambiguous and technically correct  

Although not a certification exam, this project mirrors the editorial standards required for AWS Certification exam documentation, practice materials, and technical reference guides.
